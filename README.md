Ludum Dare 35
=============

Time to make a game in 2 days!

Ideas
-----

* Dragging a "snake" around a map
  * Possibly from both ends
  * Eating special shapes might resrict movement
    * How do you go around corners then? Do you even?
  * Goal?
    * Get to a certain point
    * Eat all the stuff
* Drag corners / Edges of a polygon to change shape
  * For example to match a shape that was shown to the player briefly
  * could be complicated by linking points, etc.
  * Evaluate by measuring "area difference"
  * Should probably be restricted so you can't cross lines
  * Might add textures / points inside triangles that also get distorted
  * Does not seem "fun" enough yet
