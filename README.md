Ludum Dare 35
=============

Time to make a game in 2 days!

Ideas
-----

* Dragging a "snake" around a map
  * Possibly from both ends
  * Eating special shapes might resrict movement
    * Add a tile to the side of the snake
      * How do you go around corners then? Do you even?
    * Make one part too fat to fit through gaps
  * Can the special parts be moved? Will trying to go through a special space
  * Goal?
    * Get to a certain point
    * Eat all the stuff

Current Progress
----------------

* A hexagonal map
  * randomly generated with passable and impassable tiles
* A snake
  * Can be dragged around from both ends
