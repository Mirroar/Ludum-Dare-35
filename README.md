Ludum Dare 35
=============

Time to make a game in 2 days!

Ideas
-----

* Dragging a "snake" around a map
  * Possibly from both ends
  * Eating special shapes might resrict movement
  * Goal?
* Using the "shift" key to shift
* Drag corners / Edges of a polygon to change shape
  * For example to match a shape that was shown to the player briefly
  * could be complicated by linking points, etc.
  * Evaluate by measuring "area difference"
  * Should probably be restricted so you can't cross lines
  * Might add textures / points inside triangles that also get distorted
  * Does not seem "fun" enough yet
* Have a character with multiple forms that can do different things
  * Seems like the "easy" way out
* Have a bunch of buttons / sliders that modify a shape
  * Kind of like "The Room"
  * Probably too inflexible
