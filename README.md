Ludum Dare 35
=============

Time to make a game in 2 days!

Ideas
-----

* Dragging a "snake" around a map
  * Possibly from both ends
* Using the "shift" key to shift
* Drag corners / Edges of a polygon to change shape
  * For example to match a shape that was shown to the player briefly
  * could be complicated by linking points, etc.
  * Evaluate by measuring "area difference"
